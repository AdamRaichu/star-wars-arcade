# Star Wars: Arcade Mode

This is my attempt at recreating the arcade mode found within Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars (specifically the Destroy Command Center mode). Right now it is still a **work in progress**; I'm trying to figure out how to create the different kinds of entity that I will need, balance it, create maps, make it configurable, etc.
